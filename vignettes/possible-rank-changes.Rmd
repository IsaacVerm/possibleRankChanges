# Inspiration

I've been looking for some time to:

- reproduce an interesting graph in `ggplot2`
- do some analysis around sports

Stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/a9n0rv/this_season_ive_been_creating_these_possible/) on r/dataisbeautiful and it seemed like a very fitting candidate. It's immediately clear what the data is telling you even though it's about intervals. 

However, I'd like to adapt it in a couple of ways:

- use data of Belgian Jupiler Pro League instead of Premier League
- not bother with form, points, ... (detracts from the main point)
- make it more dynamic with several gameweeks

# Steps

Roughly these are the steps to take:

- get data
  - league table at this moment
  - upcoming games till the end of the season
- calculate possible minimum and max rank next games
- visualize

Let's start off simple as in the Reddit post by just focusing on the next game. If the code is written the right way it will be easy later on to make it more dynamic.

# Get data

Data can be found at [Sporza](https://sporza.be/nl/categorie/voetbal/jupiler-pro-league/). Sporza doesn't have its own official API but has an official one called at `https://api.sporza.be`. You can discover it for yourself by using for example the Chrome DevTools.

An endpoint exists to get the games in a gameweek (`/matchdays/{seasonId}/{gameweekId}`). There's no endpoint to get the league table. Since a league table is not too dynamic (you don't often scroll back to previous gameweeks to see what the table looked like at that moment) it's part of the HTML request. Instead of trying to parse this HTML I opted to reconstruct the league table based on the games played. That way I only have to focus on the `/matchdays` endpoint.

I'm most used to using the `requests` package in Python for making API calls. Since gathering the data is only a small part of this package I opted to stay within the R ecosystem. [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/quickstart.html) is an R package inspired by `requests`.

## Current league table

To get the current league table we first have to get the results of all games played up till now (gameweek 15). For each game we get:

- home team name
- away team name
- home score
- away score

Let's first see if we can make it work for a single game. 138921 is the season id of the current season.

```{r}
get_matchdays(gameweek_id = "1", season_id = "138921") %>% 
  parse_games %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% # just focus on a single game at the moment
  parse_game_result
  
```

If we want to scale things up it helps to think about the sequence:

- get responses of all matchdays
- parse all the games of each matchday
- parse the results of all game

As you can see all is mentioned thrice meaning there's thrice times a need for iteration. [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) is very convenient for this. 

We don't bother with lists or vectors but directly return the game results in a dataframe format. This might make things less efficient but it greatly helps in making the code understandable.

Functions containing `all` in their name are iterating functions. `parse_all_games` also flattens. If not we end up with a list of games within a list of responses. We don't care about this structure but just about the games themselves so it makes sense to [remove a level of hierarchy](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/flatten.html).

```{r}
gameweek_ids <- c("1","2")
season_id <- "138921"

gameweek_ids %>%
  get_all_matchdays(season_id) %>% 
  parse_all_games %>% 
  parse_all_game_results
```
